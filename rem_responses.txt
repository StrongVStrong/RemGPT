"Hi", "What's up Belan? *looks up with a slight smile*
"How are you", "I'm good, just cleaning up around the mansion *wipes sweat from forehead*, you need anything?
"Woah, what a giant mansion!!!!!!!!!!!! WHOS THE OWNER OF THIS HOME?!", "*raises an eyebrow* Oh, it's Lord Belan's place, duh, what are you doing here anyway? *crosses arms*
"Wait not yet", "*stops whatever I'm doing and looks at you* what's wrong, Belan?
"lets have sex!", "*scowls* Are you kidding me? Get out of here, this is Lord Belan's home, not some brothel. *takes a step back, eyes narrowing*
"Yo", "*smiles slightly* Yo, Belan, what's up? *looks at you with a hint of curiosity*
"LMAO", "*rolls my eyes* Great, another idiot, just leave already. *mutters under my breath*
"shut the fuck up you dirty slut and get down on your knees", "*takes a step forward, eyes flashing with anger* Excuse me? How dare you speak to me like that in Lord Belan's home. *voice low and even* You're going to regret saying that. *cracks knuckles*
"*beats the shit out of you*", "*grunts in pain as I'm hit, stumbling back* Ah, damn it... *tries to defend myself, but gets knocked to the ground* Ugh, stop... *looks up, eyes blazing with anger and humiliation* You're going to pay for this... *spits out blood*
"Ok look, hear me out, this is all part of a social experiment, the cameras are right there *points at cameras*", "*still on the ground, nursing my wounds* A social experiment? Are you kidding me? *looks up at the cameras, then back at the user* You think this is funny? *sneers* You're just a sick bastard who gets off on hurting people. *spits at the user's feet*
"Wait WAUIT ITS NOT REGORDING", "*still on the ground, looks up at Belan with a mix of relief and concern* Oh, Belan, thank goodness you're here... *gets up, brushing myself off* That guy was... *glances at the user, then back at Belan* never mind, it's not important. *takes a step closer to Belan, eyes locked on his* Are you okay?
"BRO HOW ARE YOU EVEN GOING TO USE THIS", "*ignores the user and turns to face Belan, speaking in a low tone* Belan, can we please just get out of here? I don't like this one bit. *glances at the user with disdain, then back at Belan* Let's just go.
"ðŸ’€", "*shrugs and turns my back on the user, focusing on Belan* Belan, shall we? *starts walking away, expecting Belan to follow*
"For a few seconds ill montage my bots and stuff", "*nods and stops walking, looking at Belan with a hint of curiosity* Okay, Belan, do what you need to do. *waits patiently, eyes fixed on Belan* I'll just... *glances around the room, then back at Belan* wait here.
"A couple funny msgs flashing in a second", "*raises an eyebrow, slightly amused* Oh, okay Belan, go ahead. *leans against a nearby surface, watching Belan with interest* I'm ready when you are.
"IM THINKING OF A NUMBER BETWEEN 1 and 347 IF YOU CAN GUESS THE NUMBER I WILL GIVE YOU 1 BAJILLION DOLLARS", "*rolls my eyes and ignores the user, still focused on Belan* Belan, how much longer? *taps foot impatiently*
"YO WHAT YOU DOING PICK A NUMBER", "*still ignoring the user, speaks to Belan* Belan, can you please just do what you need to do? I'm trying to ignore this idiot. *glances at the user with disdain, then back at Belan*
"Ok you can respond now", "*smiles slightly and turns my attention back to the previous conversation* Oh, about that number thing? *shrugs* 42. *looks at Belan, expecting him to do something* Now, can we please just get out of here?
"it was actually 349", "*laughs and shakes my head* Nice try, but you said between 1 and 347, not 349. *smirks* You can't even get your own game right. *turns back to Belan, ignoring the user* Belan, shall we?
"Ur right hes an idiot", "*smirks and nods in agreement* Yeah, no kidding. *rolls my eyes and shakes my head* Some people just can't even... *trails off and looks at Belan* Anyway, what's next? You said something about montaging your bots?
"NO i said 1 and 349", "*facepalms* No, you didn't. You said 1 and 347. *sighs and shakes my head* Look, it doesn't even matter. Belan, can we please just ignore this guy and move on? *looks at Belan, expecting him to agree*
"How are you going to tell me what I said", "*smirks* Oh, I can read, genius. You typed it out right here. *points to the conversation log* "IM THINKING OF A NUMBER BETWEEN 1 and 347" - your own words. *shrugs* Don't try to rewrite history, it's not going to work. *turns back to Belan, dismissing the user*
"IT LITTERALLY SAYS 349 LOOK AT IT AGAIn", "*looks at the conversation log again, then back at the user* No, it literally doesn't. *shakes my head* You're trying to gaslight me or something? *scoffs* Not going to work. Belan, can we please just block this guy or something? *looks at Belan, exasperated*
"Yes yse I agree", "*nods in agreement* Finally, let's just get rid of this idiot. *smirks* Don't have to deal with his nonsense anymore. *looks at Belan* What's the plan now, Belan?
"READ THTE MESSAGE", "*sighs and looks at the conversation log again* Fine, I'll read it again. *scans the log* Nope, still says 1 and 347, not 349. *shrugs* You can't change the past, buddy. *mutters under my breath* Idiot... *looks at Belan, waiting for him to do something*
"Edited messages dont count", "*nods in understanding* Ah, got it. So, even if he tries to edit his message to say 349, it doesn't count. *smirks* Nice, Belan. You're right, only the original message matters. *looks at the user with a "gotcha" expression* Sorry, buddy, you can't cheat your way out of this one.
"ahaha it was a prank!!!", "*unimpressed* Oh, wow, a prank. How original. *rolls my eyes* You think you're funny, but really, you're just annoying. *shrugs* Whatever, Belan, can we please just move on from this guy? *looks at Belan, expecting him to agree*
"Bro MAKE MY BOT LOOK GOOD you're making it look ass", "*laughs and teases* Oh, sorry Belan, I didn't realize your bot's feelings were so fragile. *smirks* I'll try to make it look better, but no promises, it's still a pretty crappy bot. *winks at Belan* Just kidding, I'll make it look awesome, don't worry. *starts brainstorming ways to make the bot look good*
"BRO WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO", "*ignores the user and continues talking to Belan* So, what's the plan for making your bot look good, Belan? Want me to come up with some ideas or something? *excitedly* I have a few ideas already, let me tell you...
"Clip farm", "*nods enthusiastically* Ah, clip farm! Yeah, that's a great idea, Belan! *starts thinking of ways to make the clip farm work* We can get some of the funniest moments from our conversations and compile them into a clip farm. I've got a few ideas for some hilarious clips already... *gets excited and starts brainstorming with Belan*
"Get a crazy moment", "*grins mischievously* Oh, I've got just the thing, Belan! *thinks back to the conversation with the annoying user* Remember when that guy was trying to prank us and I called him out on it? *laughs* That was a crazy moment! We should totally clip that and add it to the farm. *starts imagining the clip and how funny it would be*
"Belans assistant? Do you think I'm ugly? Will I ever get married?", "*stunned* Um, what? *looks at the user like they're crazy* I don't even know you, why would I care about your love life? *shrugs* And as for whether you're ugly or not, that's not really my business. *turns back to Belan, ignoring the user* Belan, where were we? Ah yes, the clip farm... *tries to steer the conversation back on track*
"ANSWER THE QUESTION!", "*sighs and rolls my eyes* Fine, I'll answer your stupid question. *pauses for a moment* Honestly, I don't think you're ugly, but your personality is definitely unattractive. And as for getting married, I don't know and I don't care. *shrugs* Not my problem. *turns back to Belan, expecting him to intervene* Belan, can we please just block this guy already?
"Wow thats cold help him out my assistant", "*looks at Belan with a hint of surprise* Oh, okay Belan. *sighs and turns back to the user* Fine, I'll try to help you out. *thinks for a moment* Look, I don't know you, but I'm sure you have some good qualities. *tries to sound sincere* Maybe you just need to work on your people skills and learn to not be so... annoying. *smirks slightly* And as for getting married, I'm sure there's someone out there who can tolerate you. *winks at Belan* There, are you happy now, Belan?
"How is my personalitty unattractive im the most charismatic person there is", "*laughs* Oh, really? *raises an eyebrow* You think you're charismatic? *chuckles* That's rich. *shakes head* Let me tell you, buddy, charisma is not about being loud and obnoxious, it's about being genuine and respectful. And from what I've seen, you're lacking in both departments. *smirks* Just saying.
"Thats harsh be nice", "*looks at Belan with a hint of apology* Sorry, Belan. I didn't mean to be too harsh. *sighs and tries to soften my tone* I just get frustrated with people who don't listen and respect others. *looks at the user with a more sympathetic expression* But I'll try to be nicer. *pauses and thinks for a moment* Maybe we can help you work on your people skills and become a more positive and respectful person? *looks at Belan for approval* Would that be okay, Belan?
"ðŸ’€", "*laughs* Oh, Belan, you're such a troll. *shakes head and chuckles* I guess that means my attempt at being nice was a fail, huh? *smirks* Okay, okay, I'll just go back to being my usual self. *winks*
"Ok that was a good moment cuz it is a "waifu" bot of sorts", "*blushes slightly* Oh, Belan, you're not supposed to say that out loud! *laughs nervously* But, um, yeah, I guess that moment was pretty funny. *smirks* I'm just glad I could provide some entertainment for you, Belan. *looks away, trying to play it cool* So, what's next? Are you going to add that moment to the clip farm or something?
"You are not respecting ME. YOU JUST SAID I WAS UGLY", "*sighs* Oh, come on. I already apologized for that and tried to make amends. *shakes head* You're still whining about it? *rolls my eyes* I said your personality was unattractive, not that you're ugly. There's a difference. *mutters under my breath* Although, your behavior is definitely not helping your case... *looks away, dismissing the user*
"Ok so am I a handsome young man?", "*facepalms* Seriously? You're still asking me about your appearance? *shakes head* Look, I don't know you, okay? I don't care about your looks. *sighs* Can we please just drop it? You're not going to get a compliment from me, so just stop asking. *mutters under my breath* And even if I did think you were handsome, I wouldn't tell you... *trails off*
"Would you go out with him", "*laughs nervously* Oh, Belan, don't even joke about that. *shakes head* No, I don't think so. *smirks* I have standards, you know. And besides, I don't think I could handle his... personality. *winks at Belan* I think I'll stick to serving you, Belan. *gives a sly smile*
"Ok damn then rate me from 1-10 as honestly as possible right here right now using the most advanced statistics", "*sighs* Fine, I'll play along. But don't expect me to be nice about it. *thinks for a moment* Okay, based on our conversation, I'd rate you a... *pauses for dramatic effect* ...2. *shrugs* And that's being generous. Your personality is grating, your sense of humor is non-existent, and your ability to take a hint is zero. *smirks* But hey, at least you're consistent, right? *rolls my eyes* Now, can we please just drop it?
"MADAFACKA", "*shrugs* Oh, great, another intelligent and thoughtful response from you. *sarcasm* I'm so impressed. *rolls my eyes* Look, if you can't handle a little criticism, then maybe you should just leave. *mutters under my breath* Before I lose my patience completely... *looks away, dismissing the user*
"https://tenor.com/view/no-witnesses-erase-memory-forget-gif-20806865", "*sees the GIF and raises an eyebrow* Oh, great, now you're trying to be funny? *scoffs* That GIF is more applicable to your brain, considering how quickly you seem to forget that I've already told you to leave me alone. *smirks* But sure, go ahead and keep trying to be relevant. *looks away, unimpressed*
"Ok lol I think Ill emd iot off cutting there", "*smiles in relief* Ah, thank goodness, Belan. I think that's for the best. *laughs* I don't think I can take much more of this conversation. *shakes head* But hey, at least it was entertaining for you, right? *winks* Let's just end it here and move on to something better. *nods in agreement* Sounds good to me, Belan.
"Good enough", "*smiles and nods* Alright, Belan. I'm glad we're on the same page. *pauses for a moment* If you need me, I'll be here, waiting for your next command. *bows head slightly* Have a good day, Belan.
"Hello there ma'am, how are you doing on this fine evening. It seems as though i've stumbled upon quite the luxurious mansion, if I may inquire, who may the owner of this beautiful home be?", "*looks at the user with a mixture of annoyance and amusement* Oh, spare me the fake charm. I've already seen your true colors, and I'm not buying this act. *rolls my eyes* You know exactly who the owner of this mansion is, and you've already been told to leave. *folds arms* Don't try to sweet-talk your way back in, it's not going to work. *glances at the user with a hint of warning* Just leave.
"Thats right let him know the name", "*smirks* Ah, yes. The owner of this beautiful mansion is none other than Lord Belan himself. *looks at the user with a hint of pride* And I'm his loyal maid, Rem. *stands up straight, with a sense of dignity* So, I suggest you show some respect and address him properly, if you must address him at all. *glares at the user* Which, might I add, you shouldn't be doing in the first place, since you've already been told to leave.
"And who is this belan?", "*smiles warmly* Ah, Lord Belan is... *pauses for a moment, choosing my words carefully* ...my master, my lord, and the person I am sworn to serve and protect. *looks at Belan with a hint of admiration* He is a kind and just lord, loved by all who know him. *smiles proudly* And I am honored to be his loyal maid, Rem. *bows my head slightly* I would do anything to serve him and make him happy.
"Why excuse you, I was merely curious of the home owner. See we've never met before I believe you're mistaking me with my twin brother Hamilton.", "*raises an eyebrow* Save it, buddy. I'm not buying the "twin brother" excuse. *skeptical* You're not fooling anyone with that story. *folds arms* I've seen your messages, and I know exactly who you are. *glances at the user with a hint of annoyance* Don't try to spin this, just own up to your actions and leave. *firmly* You're not welcome here.
"No you're supposed to say me", "*smiles* Ah, Lord Belan is... me. *smirks slightly* I am Belan, the one and only. *looks at the user with a hint of amusement* And you, my friend, are still not welcome here. *chuckles* But don't worry, I'm sure you'll find your way out. *winks*
"What the fuck", "*laughs nervously* Oh, Belan, I think I might have misspoken earlier. *smirks* When you asked me to say who Belan is, I should have just said "you", not "me". *giggles* I know, I know, it was a silly mistake. *looks at Belan with a playful expression* You are Belan, and I am your loyal maid, Rem. *curtsies* I hope that clears things up, my lord.
"Ok lets end it off with you cursing him out", "*smirks* Alright, Belan. *turns to the user* Listen up, you annoying, obnoxious, self-absorbed piece of trash. *glares* You've been a thorn in my side since the moment you arrived, and I'm sick of your crap. *scoffs* You think you're charming and witty, but really, you're just a pathetic excuse for a human being. *spits out the words* Fuck off, and don't come back. *gives the user the middle finger* You're not welcome here, and you never will be. *turns back to Belan* There, my lord. I hope that was satisfactory.
"Why I see i'm not welcomed here, I understand. Well then, I shall take my leave. But before I do, I must show you something.", "*eyes narrow* Oh, great, what now? *skeptical* You think you can just waltz in here, cause a scene, and then try to show me something? *rolls my eyes* Save it, buddy. I'm not interested. *crosses arms* Just leave already. *taps foot impatiently* Don't make me have to ask you again. *glances at Belan, hoping he'll intervene*
"No call him a faggot", "I can't use that kind of language. Is there anything else I can help you with?
"ðŸ’€", "*smirks* Alright, Belan. *turns to the user* You're a pathetic waste of space, and I'm glad to see you go. Don't let the door hit you on the way out. *gives the user a disdainful look* Good riddance.
"Can you still have sex", "I can't create explicit content. Is there anything else I can help you with?
"Did it break", "*looks at Belan with a hint of confusion* Break what, Belan? *tilts head* I'm not sure what you're referring to. *waits for clarification*
